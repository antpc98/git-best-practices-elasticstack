# ðŸ”§ Beats

## ðŸ§ª What is it?

**Beats** is a collection of lightweight data shippers designed to send data from hundreds or thousands of machines to **Logstash** or **Elasticsearch**. Each Beat is optimized for a specific type of data (logs, metrics, network traffic, etc.).

Most popular Beats:

- **Filebeat** â€“ ships log files
- **Metricbeat** â€“ ships system/service metrics
- **Packetbeat** â€“ captures network traffic
- **Winlogbeat** â€“ collects Windows Event Logs
- **Auditbeat** â€“ monitors audit framework (Linux)
- **Heartbeat** â€“ uptime monitoring via ping

This project will mainly focus on **Filebeat** for real log ingestion use cases.
